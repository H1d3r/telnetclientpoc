/* Microsoft Telnet Client MS-TNAP Server-Side Authentication Token Exploit
 * ========================================================================
 * This Proof of Concept (PoC) exploits a vulnerability in the MS-TNAP protocol
 * used by the Microsoft Telnet Client. When a client connects to a Telnet server
 * via telnet.exe or telnet:// URI hyperlinks and the MS-TNAP extension is detected,
 * the client prompts the user with a warning:
 *
 * "You are about to send your password information to a remote computer in Internet zone.
 * This might not be safe. Do you want to send anyway (y/n):"
 *
 * If the user responds "yes", this PoC completes the MS-TNAP process and extracts
 * cryptographic authentication material, which can be used for NTLM relaying or
 * offline cracking attacks. This application will write a telnetclientpoc.log with 
 * NTLM trace data extracted from the connection. It will also write hashcat compatible
 * NTLMv1/NetNTLMv2 responses to a file for offline hash cracking.
 *
 * Compile with:
 * cl telnetclientpoc.cpp getopt.cpp stdafx.cpp /EHsc /MT ws2_32.lib secur32.lib
 *
